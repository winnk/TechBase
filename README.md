1. Configuration/dependencies
  * Node.js, bower, Ember, Ember-cli, Broccoli, Bootstrap
  * Node.js provides a minimalist JavaScript library focused on backend, 'server-side' web applications services and provides features such as asynchronous and event driven actions. Libraries and frameworks run on top of Node.
  * Bower compliments Node as a front-end package manager to maintain and update libraries such as CSS, jQuery and other frameworks. Bower runs alongside NPM providing the services that Ember runs on.
  * Ember is a framework that provides a model-view pattern to help developers create and manage complex applications by "componentizing" features. This allows for improved CRUD practices enabling scalabilty. Ember runs on top of Node and Bower and is dependent on their services
  * Broccoli library is a build tool for managing the architecture, asset pipeline and performing system and user defined build tasks. Broccoli is backend agnostic but in this project it runs through Node.
